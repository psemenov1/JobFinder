Currently we are creating a chrome extension to help people find jobs. 
You can manually enter information into the extension and using an Adzuna API it looks for jobs using keywords to match up the person and the open positions.
The information is stored in your own chrome cloud so each person has there own storage system that is attached to their chrome account.

There are still some issues the team is facing. We are working on getting credentials for the API. and we will continue improving the UI.

A future goal that may currently be out of scope is parcing and extracting information from PDFs to manually input information and find jobs that may match your description.

If you have any advice for our team please let us know!
